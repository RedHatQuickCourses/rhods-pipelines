= Elyra Pipelines

Elyra provides a visual pipeline editor for building pipelines from Python and R scripts as well as Jupyter notebooks, simplifying the conversion of multiple files into batch jobs or workflows. A pipeline in Elyra consists of nodes that are connected with each other to define execution dependencies.

image::elyra_jupyter.png[Jupyter with elyra]

Elyra's visual pipeline editor lets you assemble pipelines by dragging and dropping supported files onto the canvas and defining their dependencies. After you've assembled the pipeline and are ready to run it, the editor takes care of generating the Tekton YAML definition on the fly and submitting it to the Data Science Pipelines backend.

== Creating a Data Science Pipeline with Elyra

In order to create Elyra pipelines with the visual pipeline editor:

* Launch JupyterLab with the Elyra extension installed.
* Create a new pipeline by clicking on the Elyra `Pipeline Editor` icon.
* Add each node to the pipeline by dragging and dropping notebooks or scripts from the file browser onto the pipeline editor canvas.
* Connect the nodes to define the flow of execution.
* Configure each node by right-clicking on it, clicking 'Open Properties', and setting the appropriate runtime image and file dependencies.
* You can also inject environment variables, secrets, and define output files.
* Once the pipeline is complete, you can submit it to the Data Science Pipelines engine.

== Elyra runtime configuration

A runtime configuration provides Elyra access to the Data Science Pipelines backend for scalable pipeline execution. You can manage runtime configurations using the JupyterLab UI or the Elyra CLI. The runtime configuration is included and is pre-configured for submitting pipelines to Data Science Pipelines. Refer to the https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/runtime-conf.html#kubeflow-pipelines-configuration-settings[Elyra documentation] for more information about Elyra and the available runtime configuration options.

== Exercise: offline scoring for fraud detection

=== Setup

Let's walk through an example of creating and running an Elyra pipeline for fraud detection. We'll first set up the prerequisites to get started with Elyra and Data Science Pipelines.

[NOTE]
====
Data Science Pipelines has two major dependencies: OpenShift Pipelines and S3 object storage. The setup of OpenShift Pipelines and Minio for S3 has already been covered earlier in this course, so we won't discuss it here.
====

==== Set up Data Science Pipelines

Data Science Pipelines relies on a backend S3 object storage for persisting artifacts, logs, and outputs that are associated with individual pipeline runs.

[NOTE]
====
Any S3-compliant storage solution can be used for Data Science Pipelines, including AWS S3, OpenShift Data Foundation, or Minio. In this course we will use Minio as a particularly lightweight S3 storage solution. Red Hat recommends OpenShift Data Foundation in scenarios where data resilience and desaster recovery are important concerns.
====

Create a new data science project called `fraud-detection`. Enter the project.

Under `Pipelines`, select `Create a pipeline server`.

image::create_pipeline_server.png[]

Under `Object storage connection`, select `Create new data connection`.

* Enter the following details:
* Name: `fraud-detection-pipelines`
* Access key: `minio`
* Secret key: `minio123`
* Endpoint: `http://minio-service.minio.svc:9000`
* Bucket: `fraud-detection-pipelines`

image::configure_pipeline_server.png[]

Hit `Configure`.

==== Prepare the bucket

Log into the Minio console.

Create a new S3 bucket named `fraud-detection` in Minio.

Download the `model-latest.onnx` file from the https://github.com/mamurak/os-mlops-artefacts/tree/fraud-detection-model-v0.1/models/fraud-detection[model artefact repository] and upload it to the S3 bucket.

Download the `live-data.csv` file from the https://github.com/mamurak/os-mlops-artefacts/tree/fraud-detection-data-v0.1/data/fraud-detection[data set repository] and upload it to the S3 bucket.

image::fraud-detection-bucket.png[]

==== Import the custom workbench image

Return to the RHOAI dashboard.

Under `Settings` select `Notebook images`.

Select `Import new image`.

Enter the following details:

* Repository: `quay.io/mmurakam/workbenches:fraud-detection-v1.0.1`
* Name: `Fraud detection workbench`
* Optionally a description.

image::import-workbench-image.png[]

Hit `Import`.

==== Set up the workbench

In the fraud-detection data science project, create a new data workbench and enter the following details:

* Name: `fraud-detection-workbench`
* Notebook image: `Fraud detection workbench`
* Container size: `Small`
* Create a new persistent storage with name `fraud-detection` and size 5 GB.
* Use a data connection -> Create new data connection, enter the connection parameters for consuming the `fraud-detection` bucket.

image::create-workbench.png[]

Hit `Create workbench`.

==== Set up pipeline storage

We'll now create a persistent volume that the pipeline will use to persist and exchange data across tasks.

Select `Add cluster storage`. Give it the name `offline-scoring-data-volume` and set `Persistent storage size` to 5 GB.

Hit `Add storage`.

image::pipeline-storage.png[]

Finally, once the fraud detection workbench is up and running, access it.

=== Working with Elyra

==== The code

Within the workbench, clone the course git repository:
```
https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhods-qc-apps.git
```
Within the cloned repository, navigate to the `5.pipelines/elyra` folder. The folder contains all the code that is needed for running offline scoring with a given model. In particular, it contains the Python modules:

* `data_ingestion.py` for downloading a dataset from an S3 bucket,
* `preprocessing.py` for preprocessing the downloaded dataset,
* `model_loading.py` for downloading a model artefact from an S3 bucket,
* `scoring.py` for running the classification on the preprocessed data using the downloaded model,
* `results_upload.py` for uploading the classification results to an S3 bucket.

[NOTE]
====
In Elyra, each pipeline step is implemented by a separate file such as Python modules in our example. In line with software development best practices, pipelines are best implemented in a modular fashion, i.e. across several components. This way, generic pipeline tasks like data ingestion can be re-used in many different pipelines addressing different use cases.
====

Explore these Python modules to get an understanding of the workflow. A few points of note:

Three tasks (data ingestion, model loading, results upload) access the S3 backend. Instead of hardcoding the connection parameters into the pipeline code, these parameters are instead read from the environment at runtime:
```
s3_endpoint_url = environ.get('AWS_S3_ENDPOINT')
s3_access_key = environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
s3_secret_key = environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
s3_bucket_name = environ.get('AWS_S3_BUCKET')
```
This approach is in line with best practices of handling credentials and allows us to control which S3 buckets are consumed in a given runtime context without changing the code. Importantly, these parameters are stored in a data connection, which is mounted into workbenches and pipeline pods to expose their values to the pipeline tasks.

Three tasks (preprocessing, scoring, results upload) require access to files that were stored by previous tasks. This is not an issue if we execute the code within the same filesystem like in the workbench, but since each task is later executed within a separate container in Data Science Pipelines, we can't assume that the tasks automatically have access to each other's files. Note that the dataset and result files are stored and read within a given data folder (`/data`), while the model artefact is stored and read in the respective working directory. We will see later how Elyra is capable of handling data passing in these contexts.

==== Running the code interactively

The Python modules cover the offline scoring tasks end-to-end, so we can run the code in the workbench to perform all needed tasks interactively.

For this, open the `offline-scoring.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. This notebook references each of the Python modules, so once you execute the notebook cells, you're executing the individual tasks implemented in the modules. This is a great way to develop, test, and debug the code that the pipeline will execute.

[NOTE]
====
It's not recommended to rely on workbenches and Jupyter notebooks for production use cases. Implement your pipeline code in native Python modules and test it interactively in a notebook session. Applying the code in production requires stability, auditability, and reproducibility, which workbenches and Jupyter notebooks are not designed for.
====

==== Building the pipeline

Let's now use Elyra to package the code into a pipeline and submit it to the Data Science Pipelines backend in order to:

* rely on the pipeline scheduler to manage the pipeline execution without having to depend on my workbench session,
* keep track of the pipeline execution along with the previous executions,
* be able to control resource usage of individual pipeline tasks in a fine-grained manner.

Within the workbench, open the launcher by clicking on the blue plus button.

image::launcher.png[]

Click on the `Pipeline Editor` tile in the launcher menu. This opens up Elyra's visual pipeline editor. Use the visual pipeline editor to drag-and-drop files from the file browser onto the canvas area. These files then define the individual tasks of your pipeline.

The pipeline should start by ingesting the dataset that we want to classify, so drag the `data_ingestion.py` module onto the empty canvas.

image::pipeline-1.png[]

Next, the ingested data should be preprocessed, so drag the `preprocessing.py` module onto the canvas, right next to the `data_ingestion.py` module.

image::pipeline-2.png[]

We have now defined two tasks of the pipeline, but the order of processing is not defined yet. To instruct Elyra to start with data ingestion and perform preprocessing only after data ingestion has finished, connect the `Output Port` (right black dot of the task icon) of the `data_ingestion` task with the `Input Port` (left black dot of the task icon) of the `preprocessing` task by drawing a line between these ports (click, hold & draw, release).

image::pipeline-3.png[]

You should now see the two nodes connected through a solid line. We have now defined a simple pipeline with two tasks, which are executed sequentially, first data ingestion and then preprocessing.

[NOTE]
====
By visually defining pipeline tasks and connections, we can define _graphs_ spanning many nodes and interconnections. Elyra and Data Science Pipelines support the creation and execution of arbitrary _directed acyclic graphs_ (DAGs), i.e. graphs with a sequential order of nodes and without loops.
====

Now add the `scoring.py` and `results_upload.py` modules to the pipeline and connect them to form a straight 4-step pipeline.

image::pipeline-4.png[]

It looks like we have captured the end-to-end process of offline scoring from data ingestion to scoring and results upload, but there is one step missing. A closer look at the `scoring.py` module reveals that it requires not only the preprocessed data from the previous `preprocessing.py` step but also the model file, which is created by the `model_loading.py` module. So we have to ensure that model loading is executed before scoring. However, since model loading does not depend on data ingestion and preprocessing, we can have these tasks executed in parallel. To do this, add the `model_loading.py` onto the canvas and connect its `Output Port` with the `Input Port` of `scoring.py`.

image:pipeline-5.png[]

We have now created the final graph representation of the offline scoring pipeline using the five available modules. With this we have fully defined the full pipeline code and its order of execution. 

==== Configuring the pipeline

Before we can submit our pipeline, we have to configure the pipeline to specify:

* the set of dependencies for each step, i.e. the corresponding runtime images,
* how data is passed between the steps,
* how the S3 credentials are exposed as environment variables during runtime,
* and, optionally, the available compute resources per step.

Corresponding to our custom workbench image, there is a custom pipeline runtime image containing the same libraries, which we will use throughout the pipeline tasks.

[NOTE]
====
For every custom workbench image, we recommend building a corresponding pipeline runtime image to ensure consistency between interactive and pipeline-based code execution.
====

Before we can use a custom runtime image in our pipeline, we have to add it to the Elyra runtime image library. To do this, open the `Runtime Images` menu from the left toolbar.

Select `Create new runtime image` via the plus sign in the top portion of the menu.

image::runtime-images.png[]

Fill out the required values:

* display name: `fraud detection runtime`
* image name: `quay.io/mmurakam/runtimes:fraud-detection-v0.2.0`

image::runtime-image-2.png[]

Hit `Save & Close`.

Let's now set this runtime image in our pipeline. To do this, open the pipeline settings in the Elyra pipeline editor via `Open Panel` in the top right corner of the editor.

image::pipeline-config-1.png[]

You can now see the `PIPELINE PROPERTIES` tab of the settings menu. Here you can configure the default settings that are applied on all pipeline tasks.

Scroll down to `Generic Node Defaults` and click on the drop down menu of `Runtime Image`. Select the `fraud detection runtime` that we just defined.

We can use the `Kubernetes Secrets` setting to expose our data connection parameters to the pipeline tasks as environment variables. For each of the data connection parameters, add an entry to `Kubernetes Secrets` with the following values:

* `Environment Variable`: the parameter name,
* `Secret Name`: `aws-connection-fraud-detection` (the name of the Kubernetes secret belonging to the data connection),
* `Secret Key`: the parameter name.

Ensure there is an entry for each of the parameters:

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT`
* `AWS_S3_BUCKET`

image::pipeline-config-3.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The AWS default region is another parameter in the data connection, which is used for AWS S3-based connections. In case of self-managed S3 backends such as Minio or OpenShift Data Foundation, this parameter can be safely ignored.
====

[NOTE]
====
For simplicity, we have just defined a single runtime image and set of environment variables that are reused in each pipeline task. To optimize pipeline task behavior and control access to credentials, we recommend configuring these settings on a node basis.
====

Let's now set up data passing between the pipeline steps, in particular the model artifact and the dataset.

Click on the `model_loading.py` node. If you're still in the configuration menu, you should now see the `NODE PROPERTIES` tab. If not, right-click on the node and select `Open Properties`.

image::pipeline-config-4.png[]

You can now view and edit the node-specific settings for the selected node. Under `Runtime Image` and `Kubernetes Secret`, you can see that the global pipeline settings are used by default. 

In the `Outputs` section, you can declare one or more _output files_. These output files are created by this pipeline task and are made available to all subsequent tasks.

[NOTE]
====
By default, all files within a containerized task are removed after its execution, so declaring files explicitly as output files is one way to ensure that they can be reused in downstream tasks.
====

`Add` the file `model.onnx` as an output file. This ensures that the downloaded model artifact is available to the `scoring.py` task.

image::pipeline-config-5.png[]

Let's now enable passing the dataset and results between the pipeline tasks. For this, open the node properties of the `data_ingestion.py` node. Instead of declaring the downloaded data file as an output file, we'll pass it through a mounted volume.

[NOTE]
====
Output files are uploaded by Elyra to the corresponding S3 bucket of the respective pipeline run. This is useful for tracking the intermediate results and artifacts produced within the pipeline.

If a task generates a large number of volume of data that need to be passed, network traffic and storage capacity for the intermediate results may become an issue. In this case, it is recommended to pass the data through mounted volumes, which prevents sending these files to the S3 backend.
====

Scroll down to `Data Volumes` and select `Add`.

In the `Mount Path` field enter `/data`, which is where our pipeline tasks are storing and reading the data and results files. 

In the `Persistent Volume Claim Name` field enter `offline-scoring-data-volume`, which refers to the cluster storage that we created earlier for this pipeline.

image::pipeline-config-6.png[]

Add this data volume entry to the nodes `preprocessing.py`, `scoring.py`, and `results_upload.py`.

[NOTE]
====
We could have declared the data volume as a global pipeline property for simplicity. However, this would have prevented parallel execution of model loading and data ingestion/preprocessing since data volumes can only be used by single tasks by default.
====

Finally, rename the pipeline file to `offline-scoring.pipeline` and hit `Save Pipeline` in the top toolbar.

image::pipeline-config-7.png[]

==== Running the pipeline

We have now fully created and configured the pipeline, so let's now see it in action!

In the visual editor, click on the Play icon (`Run Pipeline`). Leave the default values and hit `OK`.

Elyra is now converting your pipeline definition into a Tekton YAML representation and sending it to the Data Science Pipelines backend. After a few second you should see confirmation that the pipeline has been successfully submitted.

image::pipeline-submit.png[]

To monitor the pipeline's execution, you can click on the `Run Details` link, which takes you to the pipeline run view within the RHOAI dashboard. Here you can track in real-time how each pipeline task is processed and whether it fails or resolves successfully.

image::pipeline-run.png[]

To confirm that the pipeline has indeed produced fraud detection scoring results, view the content of the `fraud-detection` bucket. You should now see a new CSV file containing the predicted result of each transaction within the used dataset.

image::fraud-detection-bucket-2.png[]

If you head back to the `Runs` overview in the RHOAI dashboard, you can see the history of all ongoing and previous pipeline executions and compare their run durations and status.

image::pipeline-runs.png[]

In the `Scheduled` tab you're able to schedule runs of the offline scoring pipeline according to a predefined schedule such as daily or according to a Cron statement.

image::pipeline-scheduled.png[]

==== Tracking the pipeline artifacts

Let's finally peek behind the scenes and inspect the S3 bucket that Elyra and Data Science Pipelines use to store the pipeline artifacts.

View the contents of the `fraud-detection-pipelines` bucket, which we referenced through the `pipelines` data connection. You can see three types of folders:

* `pipelines`: A folder used by Data Science Pipelines to store all pipeline definitions in Tekton YAML format.
* `artifacts`: A folder used by Data Science Pipelines to store the metadata of each pipeline task for each pipeline run.
* One folder for each pipeline run with name `[pipeline-name]-[timestamp]`. These folders are managed by Elyra and contain all file dependencies, log files, and output files of each task.

[NOTE]
====
If you need to troubleshoot a pipeline, the log files within the Elyra bucket are the best place to check any code-related issues. Other places are the Tekton run and pod events logs, which reveal integration or infrastructure-related problems.
====

image::pipelines-bucket.png[]

image::pipeline-artifacts.png[]

Now that we have seen how to work with Data Science Pipelines through Elyra, let's take a closer look at the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK.
